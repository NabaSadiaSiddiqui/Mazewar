Steps to run the game:  
1. Run 'Make'  
2. Start the server as `./server portNumber`  
3. Start the clients as `./run server_hostName server_portNumber client_hostName client_portNumber`
  
The game makes the following assumptions:  
1. All player names are unique  
2. All players enter the correct hostName and portNumber they are listening on  
3. Lookup server is always running
