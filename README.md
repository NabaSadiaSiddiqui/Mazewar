Steps to run the game:  
1. Run 'Make'  
2. Start the server as `./server portNumber`  
3. Start the clients as `./run hostName portNumber`  
  
  
The game makes the following assumptions:  
1. Only 2 players can play at a time  
2. There are no dynamic joins  
3. When a player quits, you have to restart the server to start another round
